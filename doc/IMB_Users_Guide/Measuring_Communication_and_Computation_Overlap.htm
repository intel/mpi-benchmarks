<h1>Measuring Communication and Computation Overlap</h1>
<p>Semantics of nonblocking collective operations enables you to run inter-process communication in the background while&#160;performing computations. However, the actual overlap depends on the particular MPI library implementation. You can measure a potential overlap of communication and computation using <samp class="codeph">IMB-NBC</samp> benchmarks. The general benchmark flow is as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>Measure the time needed for a pure communication call.</li>
<li>Start a nonblocking collective operation.</li>
<li>Start computation using the <samp class="codeph">IMB_cpu_exploit</samp> function, as described in the <a href="Non-Blocking_I_O_Benchmarks.htm">IMB-IO Nonblocking Benchmarks</a> chapter. To ensure correct measurement conditions, the computation time used by the benchmark is close to the pure communication time measured at step 1. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
<li>Wait for communication to finish using the <samp class="codeph">MPI_Wait</samp> function.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Displaying Results</h2>
<p>The timing values to interpret the overlap potential are as follows:</p>
<ul class="hcp1">
<li>
<p><samp class="codeph">t_pure</samp> is the time of a pure communication operation, non-overlapping with CPU activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><samp class="codeph">t_CPU</samp>&#160;is the time the <samp class="codeph">IMB_cpu_exploit</samp> function takes to complete when run concurrently with the nonblocking communication operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><samp class="codeph">t_ovrl</samp> is the time of the nonblocking communication operation takes to complete when run concurrently with a CPU activity.</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
<ul class="hcp1">
<li>
<p>If <samp class="codeph">t_ovrl = max(t_pure,t_CPU)</samp>, the processes are running with a perfect overlap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <samp class="codeph">t_ovrl = t_pure+t_CPU</samp>, the processes are running with no overlap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since different processes in a collective operation may have different execution times, the timing values are taken for the process with the biggest <samp class="codeph">t_ovrl</samp> execution time. The <samp class="codeph">IMB-NBC</samp> result tables report the timings <samp class="codeph">t_ovrl</samp>, <samp class="codeph">t_pure</samp>, <samp class="codeph">t_CPU</samp> and the estimated overlap in percent calculated by the following formula:</p>
<p><samp class="codeph">overlap = 100.*max(0,min(1, (t_pure+t_CPU-t_ovrl) / min(t_pure, t_CPU))</samp></p>
